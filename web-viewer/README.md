# Web-viewer sandbox

Normally, I would want to use ROS for communicating data between processes, however it adds a layer of complexity in code and deployment. This is a place where I can scaffold my solutions and just have processes communicate using shared memory.

## Getting started

Activate ytour environment

`conda activate opencv3`

pip install flask
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.13.47
pip install imutils
