# Repository for computer vision based guidance systems for robots

## Getting started

If you plan only on using the docker container based deployment you should only need docker.

If you plan on developing, you should start by creating a python3 env (I called mine "opencv3" since opencv 3.* will be used because not all code has yet been ported to opencv 4.*)

`conda create -n opencv3 python=3`
